    !!! Note
        OWL Ontologies typically lacks some information that is required for making a complete
        data model. This means that the methods .to_rules() will typically fail. Instead, it is recommended
        that you use the .to_spreadsheet() method to generate an Excel file, and then manually add the missing
        information to the Excel file. The Excel file can then be converted to a `Rules` object.

        Alternatively, one can set the `make_compliant` parameter to True to allow neat to attempt to make
        the imported rules compliant by adding default values for missing information, attaching dangling
        properties to default containers based on the property type, etc. One has to be aware
        that NEAT will be opinionated about how to make the ontology compliant, and that the resulting
        rules may not be what you expect.
