    """Parse IMF elements from RDF-graph and extract properties to pandas dataframe.

    Args:
        graph: Graph containing imf elements
        language: Language to use for parsing, by default "en"

    Returns:
        List of dictionaries containing properties extracted from IMF elements

    !!! note "IMF Compliance"
        The IMF elements are expressed in RDF, primarily using SHACL and OWL. To ensure
        that the resulting properties are compliant with CDF, similar validation checks
        as in the OWL ontology importer are applied.

        For the IMF-types more of the compliance logic is placed directly in the SPARQL
        query. Among these are the creation of class and property names not starting
        with a number, ensuring property types as well as default cardinality boundraries.

        IMF-attributes are considered both classes and properties. This kind of punning
        is necessary to capture additional information carried by attributes. They carry,
        among other things, a set of relationsships to reference terms, units of measure,
        and qualifiers that together make up the meaning of the attribute. These references
        are listed as additional properties with default values.
