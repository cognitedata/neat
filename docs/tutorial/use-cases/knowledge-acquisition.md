# Knowledge Acquisition

This tutorial covers how to use `neat` for knowledge acquisition and produce a shared data model in
Cognite Data Fusion (CDF).

## Introduction
Companies typically have multiple domain experts that cover different areas of the business. Typically, these
areas are partially overlapping, both in concepts and data. Lots of the value in a product like CDF comes from
taking data from different sources and making it easily accessible and understandable for all domain experts, as
this unlocks the potential for cross-domain insights.

Knowledge acquisition is the process of taking the knowledge from domain experts and turning it into a shared
data model. `neat` has been designed to facilitate this process by providing a way to define a shared data model.

## Use Case
In this tutorial, we will focus on the Power & Utilities industry. We will have two domain experts, one that
focuses on wind turbine maintenance and one that focuses on grid analysis, lets call them Jon and Emma. In addition,
we will have a data engineer, let's call him David, who will be responsible for combining the knowledge from Jon and
Emma into a shared data model. Finally, we have a CDF expert, let's call her Alice, who will be responsible for
implementing the shared data model in CDF. Note that in a real-world scenario, the data engineer and the CDF expert
might be the same person, but for the purpose of this tutorial, we will keep them separate to highlight that their
required skills are different.

**Note** You don't need to be an expert in the Power & Utilities industry to follow this tutorial. The concepts
are generic and can be applied to any industry in which you have domain experts with overlapping knowledge and data.

## Wind Turbine Maintenance Expert: Jon
