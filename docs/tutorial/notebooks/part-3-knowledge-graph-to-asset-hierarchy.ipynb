    "Up until this notebook you did not need to have [Cognite Data Fusion](https://www.cognite.com/en/product/cognite_data_fusion_industrial_dataops_platform) instance running. However, for this notebook, CDF is prerequisite, as well client configured to interact for CDF. How to configure CDF as well client is beyond this notebook and tutorial. We suggest you to find appropriate information at [Cognite Developer Center](https://developer.cognite.com/dev/#authenticate).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Part 3 of tutorial we will describe how NEAT generates asset hierarchy (i.e., CDF classic graph) from RDF graph (i.e. knowledge graph) as depicted at the following image:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../figs/rdf2cdf-graph.jpg\"  width=\"75%\" alt=\"RDF2CDF\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The aforementioned image shows high level flow from RDF graph to CDF graph. As we can see an RDF graph can be decoupled to:\n",
    "- nodes (i.e. instances of specific classes)\n",
    "- edges (i.e., relationships that connect nodes)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand CDF graph based on asset-centric data model (aka, classic CDF), consists of:\n",
    "- assets\n",
    "- asset hierarchy \n",
    "- relationships among assets\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, based on the transformation rules, NEAT converts:\n",
    "- RDF nodes to CDF assets\n",
    "- certain type(s) of RDF edges to CDF asset hierarchy\n",
    "- certain type(s) of RDF edges to CDF relationships between assets \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First download transformation rules from this [link](https://github.com/cognitedata/neat/blob/main/cognite/neat/examples/rules/source-to-solution-mapping-rules.xlsx) and place it at an appropriate location. Alternatively, if you have cloned `neat` repository, find file in:\n",
    "\n",
    " `./cognite/neat/exaples/rules/source-to-solution-mapping-rules.xlsx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These transformation rules are a bit more extensive than in previous parts, containing more detailed data model. Their details we will be covered in Part 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for convenience store configuration of a Cognite client in `.env` file, with following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "TENANT_ID = ...\n",
    "CLIENT_ID = ...\n",
    "CLIENT_SECRET = ...\n",
    "CDF_CLUSTER = ...\n",
    "COGNITE_PROJECT = ...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This file will be loaded as config dictionary and used to configure the Cognite client.\n",

Afterwards it find difference in relationships (i.e., edges) between these two graphs, thus identifying and decommissioning relationships (curved yellow lines).
