    "This notebook represent Part 2 of NEAT Onboarding tutorial. If you have not completed previous part(s) we strongly suggest you do them first before doing this part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often we do not have knowledge graphs per se. Instead we have scattered and unconnected information which needs to be bring together to form knowledge graph.\n",
    "Also, often is useful to test how knowledge graph based on certain data model will function, for example how queries would perform if we have very large knowledge graphs or very deep knowledge graph (many hops).\n",
    "\n",
    "NEAT can help in both cases, i.e. simplify the above scenarios but requires that you have already defined data model through `Transformation Rules`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose we have prepared simple transformation rules which you can download [using this link](https://github.com/cognitedata/neat/blob/main/cognite/neat/examples/rules/power-grid-example.xlsx). Same Excel sheet is available directly as part of `examples` module of `neat`, as we demonstrated in Part 1 tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will also demonstrate both scenarios and base the demonstration on the data model defined in Part 1. \n",
    "Accordingly in this notebook we will cover:\n",

    "1. Generation of knowledge graph using Graph Capturing Sheet generated by NEAT\n",
    "2. Generation of mock knowledge graphs of arbitrary size using mock module\n",

The remaining property basically contains link to `SubGeographicalRegion` instance.
