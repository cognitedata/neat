# NEAT Components Lifecycle

The NEAT Components Lifecycle policy is a set of guidelines that govern the lifecycle of application components, from testing to formal implementation in the underlying component library. The policy outlines the various stages that a component must go through before it can be considered for inclusion in the library, including design, development, testing, and documentation. The policy also includes guidelines for maintaining and updating components over time, ensuring that they remain compatible with the latest technologies and standards. By following this policy, NEAT ensures that its component library is of high quality and meets the needs of its users.
