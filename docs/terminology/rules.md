# Rules
`Rules` is the core object in NEAT, which contains semantic data model definitions and optionally instructions on how to create the data model instances (aka, populate data model). This object is typically serialized as an spreadsheet file (Excel) which provides simple and intuitive way to create a semantic data model. The spreadsheet obeys specific template, which represents the `Rules` object. The template is designed to be user friendly and to provide a simple way to define a semantic data model, offering a familiar environment for users who are not familiar with semantic data modeling.

To lower the entry barrier for the users, `Rules` are designed to be as simple as possible and profiled based on the role that a person has in the data modeling process. Consider consulting [the data modeling lifecycle tutorial](../tutorials/data-modeling-lifecycle/overview.md) for more detail on the process. The profiles are:

- Domain Expert
- Information Architect
- DMS CDF Architect

The amount of details that are requested from the user grows with the role that the user has in the data modeling process. Accordingly we will dive into the details of the `Rules` object per role in the following sections, which will be presented through the spreadsheet serialization of the `Rules` object.

`Rules` are composed of the following sheets, which based on the role (profile) are mandatory and/or optional or require various level of details:

- `Metadata`: contains metadata about the data model
- `Classes`: contains the high level definition of the classes that are part of the semantic data model (no properties)
- `Properties`: contains the definition of the properties per class
- `Views`: contains the definition of the CDF views that represent semantic data model serialization in CDF
- `Containers`: contains the definition of the CDF containers that are physical storage for data written/read in/from views
- `Prefixes`: contains the definition of the prefixes that are used in the semantic data model
