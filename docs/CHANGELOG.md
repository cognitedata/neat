## [0.53.0] - 03-01-24

## Improved

- Speed of nodes & edges generation
- Multi namespace support for nodes & edges generation (see [feature request](https://github.com/cognitedata/neat/issues/171))

## Changed
- `cognite.neat.extractors` module. This now only has three classes: `BaseExtractor`, `MockGraphGenerator`, `GraphCapturingSheet`.
   all the functions that were in the module is replaced with the above classes. The exception is the the function
   `rdf_file_to_graph` which is moved to `cognite.neat.graph.stores`.

## [0.52.0] - 22-12-23

## Added

- Advance data modeling support introduced
- Multi space containers support introduced


## [0.51.0] - 05-12-23

## Improved

- Turning `ParentClass` string into `Entity`

## Changed
