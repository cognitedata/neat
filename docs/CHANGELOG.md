## TBD
### Added
- Support RDF Datasets in NeatGraphStore enabling writing of sources triples to dedicated named graphs

### Improved
- The `neat.infer()` no longer skips `externalId`/`external_id` properties when inferring the data model.
- Importing rules which were exported then modified externally then re-imported to the neat session

## [0.107.0] - 15-01-**2025**
### Fixed
- The `neat.prepare.instances.relationships_as_edges()` no longer creates invalid identifiers for the edges.
- The `neat.to.cdf.instances()` can now create edges with properties.

### Added
- Fast serialization of NeatGraphStore
- `neat.to.session(...)` and `neat.from.session(...)` methods to save and load a `NeatSession` object to and from a file.
- Internal support for remote oxigraph store
- Neat can now read a knowledge graph from DMS with the `neat.read.cdf.graph(...)` method.

### Improved
- Better error message if `NeatSession(..., storage="oxigraph")` and the `oxigraph` package is not installed.
- NeatIDs are now human-readable and deterministic.
- The `neat.convert()` from DMS ot information now sets the container.usedFor to "node"/"edge"/"all" based on
  how the classes are implemented.

### Changed
- [BREAKING] The `Transformation` column in the Information Data Model properties sheet has been renamed to
  `Instnace Source`.
- [BREAKING] The `neat.convert()` no longer has a property `mode` used to recognize classes that should be implemented
  as edges. Instead, information model to dms model conversion classes with both `startNode` and `endNode` properties
  are implemented as edges.

### Removed
- [BREAKING] The `neat.prepare.instances.classic_to_core()` and `neat.prepare.data_models.add_implents_to_classes()`
  methods have been removed. These were only used for the classic to core flow. The simplified classic to core flow
  now solves this automatically.

## [0.106.0] - 09-01-**2025**
### Added
- Method for setting session client, `neat.set.client(...)`.

### Fixed
- `neat.prepare.instances.make_connection_on_exact_match` can now run multiple times.
- The `mapping.data_model.classic_to_core` method now produces a `..SourceSystem` with a `guid` property that ensures
  that only instances written through this view are returned when querying it.
- The `neat.read.cdf.classic.graph(...)` now handles lack of access to CDF resources more gracefully.

### Improved
- `neat.infer(...)` and `neat.to.cdf.instances(...)` now display a progress bar if the number of instances is large.

## [0.105.2] - 08-01-**2025**
### Added
- The `get_cognite_client` function uses the current working directory to store the environment file if neat
  is not run inside a git repository.

## [0.105.1] - 08-01-**2025**
### Added
- `neat.to.cdf.instances()` now automatically ignore relations above the DMS limit of 100. This is to ensure that
  the instances are successfully loaded into CDF. A warning is issued to the user if any relations are ignored.

### Fixed
- The `neat.prepare.instances.make_connection_on_exact_match` no longer raises a `SyntaxError` when called.

## [0.105.0] - 07-01-**2025**
### Added
- All `neat.read` methods now supports reading from a URL.
- `neat.prepare.instances.connection_to_data_type(...)` added to convert connection to data type.
- `neat.prepare.instances.classic_to_core()` which bundles the preparation from classic to core.

### Fixed
- `neat.read.yaml(...)` no longer raises a `ValueError` if a view is referencing an enum property in a container
  that is not part of the model.
- `neat.read.yaml('....zip', format='toolkit')` now correctly puts containers into a subfolder in the zip file.
- `neat.to.cdf.data_model(...)` now correctly handles list of json objects in the `properties` field of a view.

### Improved
- `neat.read.yaml(..., format="toolkit")` no longer removes direct relations sources that points to views that are not
  part of the model.
- When using the `neat.prepare.data_model.to_solution(...mode="read")` and `neat.prepare.data_model.to_data_product()`
  methods, the newly created views inherits the filter from the source data model containers. This ensures that the new
  views will return the same instances as the source views.
- The `neat.prepare.data_model.to_data_product(include="same-space")` method no longer produces data models that uses
  values types that are not part of the data model. This ensures that the data model is self-contained. This is solved
  by dropping all properties that have a value type that is not part of the data model.
- The `neat.to.cdf.instances(...)` now correctly ignores read-only properties when creating instances in CDF.
- Reading sequences from CDF using `read.cdf.classic.graph(...)` now includes `rows`. In addition, the `columns` are
  now created as a list and not a blob.

### Changed
- The `neat.mapping.data_model.classic_to_core(...)` now includes all connection properties from the view that
  it is implementing.

## [0.104.0] - 20-12-**2024**
### Improved
- When using a `NeatSession` object in a notebook. The return issues now has context for what actions they
  were caused by. In addition, the `NeatSession` object now ensures a linear provenance path for the
  data modeling.

### Added
- Writing a model to Excel now includes the reference data model if the model was created from another model
  using the `prepare.data_model.to_enterprise(...)`, `neat.prepare.data_model.to_solution(...)`, or
  `neat.prepare.data_model.to_data_product(...)` methods.

## [0.103.1] - 17-12-**2024**
### Fixed

## [0.103.0] - 16-12-**2024**
### Added
- Support for converting data types with `neat.prepare.instances.convert_data_type(...)`.
- Support for converting data types to connection with `neat.prepare.instances.property_to_type(...)`.

### Fixed
- The `neat.to.cdf.instances()` now accounts for the dependencies between the views when
  creating the instances in CDF.
- Implementing a view with a reverse connection and not overwriting reverse connection from the parent,
  no longer returns a `ReversedConnectionNotFeasibleError` in `neat.verify()`.
- Dumping any data model in neat now uses `space` and not `prefix` in the Metadata sheet.

### Changed
- To the newest release of neatengine; `v.2.0.3`

## [0.102.0] - 09-12-**2024**

- Support for reading a `csv` from any URL in `neat.read.csv(...)`.

## Fixed
- The `neat.to.cdf.data_model()` no longer fails to update `space` when `existing='recreate'` and `drop_data=True`.
  Instead, spaces are now updated, while containers are successfully deleted and recreated.

## [0.100.1] - 05-12-**2024**
### Fixed
- The `neat.to.cdf.data_model()` no longer raises a `TypeError` when the `existing='recreate'` parameter is used.

## [0.96.6] - 08-11-**2024**
### Fixed
- `neat.verify()` no longer gives a `PrincipleMatchingSpaceAndVersionWarning` when you include views from
  the `CogniteCore` or `CogniteProcessIndustry` data models.

  value. For example, if the `Connection` was `edge(direction=inwards)` it would not be written to the Excel or
  YAML file as `edge` as `direction=inwards` was not the default value. This is now fixed.

## [0.96.3] - 05-11-**2024**

## [0.84.0] - 25-06-24
### Changed
- [BREAKING] Interface for `Exporters`. Instead of `.export_to_cdf` returning an iterable, it now returns a list,
  and the `.export_to_cdf_iterable` returns an iterable. In addition, these method now returns a new type of
  objects `UploadResult`. This is to make the interface more notebook friendly and easier to work with.

## [0.83.1] - 26-06-24

  was not set correctly. This is now fixed.
- In the new implementation of the conversion between Information and DMS rules, containers that already exist
  in a last or reference rule object were recreated. This is now fixed.

## [0.77.7] - 23-05-24
### Fixed
- In the `DMSImporter`, if you imported a data model with multiple views referencing the same direct property
  in a container, it would return an error. This is allowed and thus no longer return an error.
- There was an edge case that could cause the conversion between Information and DMS rules to fail with
  `MissingContainerError`. The conversion is now reimplemented to ensure that Information rules always
  will create the necessary containers in the conversion to DMS rules.

  This would trigger an error `RefMetadata sheet is missing or it failed` even though the
  ReferenceMetadata sheet is not needed.

## [0.77.3] - 14-05-24
### Fixed
- When using `DMSExporter` and importing a data model with a view pointing to a view not in the data model,
  it would fail to convert to an `Information` rules. This is now fixed.
- In the `ExcelExporter`, the `metadata` sheet is now created correctly when you use the arguments `dump_as="last"`,
  or `dump_as="reference"`, combined with and without `new_model_id`. **[Note]** The order of the `dump_as` and
  `new_model_id` arguments have switched places. This is to make it more intuitive to use the `ExcelExporter`
  as `new_model_id` is only relevant if `dump_as` is set to `last` or `reference`.

## [0.77.2] - 14-05-24
### Added
- Missing warning when `RawFilter` is used to warn users that the usage of this filter is not recommended.

  updated.

### Added
- Support for exporting/importing `Last` spreadsheets in the `ExcelExporter` and `ExcelImporter`.
- [BREAKING] As a result of the above, in the `ExcelExporter` the parameter `is_reference` is replaced by `dump_as`.
  To continue using the old behavior, set `dump_as='reference'`.
- In the `DMSImporter.from_data_model_id`, now supports setting `reference_model_id` to download a solution model
  with a reference model.

## [0.76.3] - 10-05-24
### Added
- Added schema validator for performance, specifically if views map to too many containers.


## [0.76.2] - 06-05-24
### Fixed

## [0.76.1] - 06-05-24
### Changed
- Updated DMS Architect Rules template to fit the new DMS Rules structure
- Update Terminology/Rules to reflect new DMS Rules structure

## [0.76.0] - 06-05-24
### Removed
- [BREAKING] In `DMSRules`, `default_view_version` is no longer supported. Instead, you will now get a warning if view versions
  are not matching the data model version.

### Added/Changed
- [BREAKING] The following renaming of columns in `DMSRules`, properties sheet:
    - `Relation` -> `Connection`
    - `ViewProperty` -> `View Property`
    - `ContainerProperty` -> `Container Property`
    - `IsList` -> `Is List`
    - `Class` -> `Class (linage)`
    - `Property` -> `Property (linage)`
- [BREAKING] The following renaming of columns in `DMSRules`, views sheet:
    - `InModel` -> `In Model`
    - `Class` -> `Class (linage)`
- [BREAKING] The following renaming of columns in `DMSRules`, containers sheet:
    - `Class` -> `Class (linage)`
- [BREAKING] Added support for listable direct relations in `DMSRules`. In addition, there is now a complete reimplementation
  of the `connection` column in the `DMRRules` `properties` sheet.
- [BREAKING] Connection (former relation) can now be `direct`, `reverse`, or `edge`.
  While `multiedge` and `reversedirectc` have been removed. For more details,
  see the [DMS Rules Details](https://cognite-neat.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/terminology/dmsrules.html#relation)
  documentation.
- In `DMSRules`, added support for setting containerId and nodeId in `View.Filter`. Earlier, only `nodeType` and
  `hasData` were supported which always used an implicit `containerId` and `nodeId` respectively. Now, the user can
  specify the node type and container id(s) by setting `nodeType(my_space:my_node_type)` and
  `hasData(my_space:my_container_id, my_space:my_other_container_id)`.
- Introduced, `dataModelType` in `DMSRules` and `InformationRules` to explicitly set the type of data model. This
  will be used to different types of validation and make the user aware of the type of data model they are working with.
- In `DMSExporter`, created smart defaults for setting `view.filters`. This is now recommended that the user uses
  the default values for `view.filters` and only set them explicitly if they now very well what they are doing.

## [0.75.6] - 26-04-24
### Changed
- All `NEAT` importers does not have `is_reference` parameter in `.to_rules()` method. This has been moved
  to the `ExcelExporter` `__init__` method. This is because this is the only place where this parameter was used.

### Added
- `DMSExporter` now supports skipping of export of `node_types`.

### Fixed
- When importing an `Excel` rules set with a reference model, the `ExcelImporter` would produce the warning
  `The copy method is deprecated; use the model_copy instead`. This is now fixed.
