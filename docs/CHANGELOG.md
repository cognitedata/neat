### Added
- When creating OWL from rules, prefix will be saved under property `neat:prefix` (hence change of default namespace)
- When reading OWL if there is `neat:prefix` value will be added to `rules.metadata.prefix`

### Fixed
- rdf:PlainLiteral and rdf:Literal was not resolving as string handled when exporting Rules to DMS schemas, this is now fixed
- OwlImporter that works with v2 rules was using `XSD_VALUE_TYPE_MAPPINGS` for v1 rules, this is now fixed
- added missing mapping for reference when converting information architect rules to dms architect rules

## [0.72.0] - 11-04-24
### Improved
- Improved garbadge collection process in workflows. Now all resources are properly released after workflow execution or reloading.
This is expecially critical when working with statfull objects like graph stores or big objects allocated in memory.
## Removed
- Removed a lot of old and stale code from workflows engine.
## Changed
- Changed CORS policy for UI to allow all origins. This is a temporary solution until it is properly configured in the future.

## [0.71.0] - 10-04-24
### Added
- Added `/api/core/rules2dms`
- Enabled conversion of rules to DMS views and containers

## [0.70.3] - 10-04-24

- Handling of xsd types as case insensitive when importing an OWL ontology.
### Added
- Handling of rdf:Literals in OWL ontology import as xsd:string

### Fixed
- Bug when exporting an `addition` to of a ruleset in  `DMSExporter` when using the method `.export_to_cdf`
### Changed
- Updated the `DMSExporter` to sort views in data model by (`space`, `external_id`).

## [0.70.1] - 03-04-24
### Added
- The `DMSExporter` now supports deploying an `addition` extension of a ruleset.

## [0.70.0] - 09-04-24
### Added
- Added `/api/core/convert`
- Enabled OWL importer to produce DMS rules


## [0.69.3] - 03-04-24
### Fixed
- Validation of `InformationRules` gives a warning if a reference class is used. This is now fixed.
- Validation of `InformationRules` returns an error if a importing a value type `Unknown`. This is now fixed.

## [0.69.2] - 03-04-24
### Fixed
- Fixed issue with `DMSImporter` when importing data models with direct relations without `source` set. This would
  cause a validation issue. This is now fixed.

## [0.69.1] - 03-04-24
### Fixed
- Fixed issue with `DMSImporter` when importing data models with data models that reference views outside the data model.
  This is now fixed.

## [0.69.0] - 03-04-24
### Added
- Experimental support for working with a reference model in the Rules.

### Fixed
- When using `DMSExporter` with `standardize_casing=False`, the `DMSExporter` would fail to export containers and
  views. This is now fixed.

### Changed
- When using any exporter writing to file, the default new line character and encoding of the OS was used. This is now
  changed to always use `utf-8` encoding and `'\n'` as the new line character. This is for working with **NEAT** in,
  for example, git-history, across multiple users with different OSes.
- In the `DMSExporter`, setting `existing_handling=force` will now also force the creation of `Containers` in addition
  to `Views`.

## [0.68.9] - 03-04-24
### Added
- Helper method `from_directory` and `from_zip_file` to `DMSExporter` to load DMS schema from directory or zip file.
  These methods are the complement of the `export_to_file()` method in `DMSExporter`.

## Changed
