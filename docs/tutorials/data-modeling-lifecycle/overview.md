# Overview

!!! note annotate "Warning"
    This tutorial is a work in progress and it is not yet complete.

The data modeling lifecycle is a process that domain experts, information architects and solution architects use to
design, build, and maintain data models. The lifecycle consists of several stages, each of which has its own set of
tasks and deliverables. For each stage, we have built a comprehensive tutorial on how to use **NEAT** to perform the
tasks and deliver the artifacts. The stages and the tutorials are as follows:

- **[Knowledge Acquisition](./part-1-knowledge-acquisition.md)**: In this tutorial you will learn how to gather information
  about the business requirements and the data sources that will be used to build the data model from the domain experts,
  crafting an enterprise data model that represents the business requirements and the data sources. The enterprise
  data model is fine-tuned by the solution architects to ensure that it technically aligns with the organization's data
  infrastructure, such as Cognite Data Fusion.

- **Maintenance and Evolution**: In this tutorial you will learn how to maintain and evolve the data model to keep it
  up to date with the changing business requirements and data sources. This stage is an iterative process that
  involves monitoring the data model's performance and making adjustments as needed.
