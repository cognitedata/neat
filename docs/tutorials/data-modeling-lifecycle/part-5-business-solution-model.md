## Business Solution Model

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to create a solution model for a business case
using the enterprise model as the basis. The business solution model will only use a subset
of the enterprise model and not add any new concepts. This model is intended for a business user
that only needs to select the part of the enterprise model that is relevant for their business case.

We will build on the Enterprise model from [Extending an Enterprise Data Model](./part-3-extending-enterprise-model).
