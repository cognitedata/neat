# Extending the Enterprise Model

This tutorial demonstrates how to extend the Enterprise model. Extending a model means changing it
by adding, changing, or removing any of its elements **after it hs been put in production**.

We assume that there is already an enterprise model developed, as in the
[Knowledge Acquisition](./part-1-knowledge-acquisition.md) tutorial, which will be the one we extend. In addition,
the source for the extension is the solution model developed in the [Solution Modeling](./part-2-analytic-solution.md)
tutorial.
