## Extending Solution Model

This tutorial demonstrates how to extend a solution model. Note that Extending a model means changing it
by adding, reshaping, or removing any of its elements **after it has been put in production**.

We assume that you already have a solution model built on top of an Enterprise Data Model. This
tutorial will be an extension of the [Analytic Solution Model](./part-2-analytic-solution) tutorial,
with the Enterprise Data Model from [Extending an Enterprise Data Model](./part-3-extending-enterprise-model).
