    "## Expert elicitation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the introduction of this tutorial, we have established the business question of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, a data modeling process is unknown to domain experts, especially platform-specific details (e.g., in the case of CDF that are details such as views, containers, etc.). However, domain experts understand what concepts they need information about to answer the business question. Therefore, it is crucial to interview them to extract these concepts (a process known as expert elicitation). The extracted concepts, and connections between them, form the base for what is known as **Conceptual Data Model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that we asked our domain expert how he/she is able to answer the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is a site the right one to develop a wind farm project?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We got an answer that he/she typically use a simple rule of thumb expressed with the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **7.5 * Annual Energy Production * Electricity Price >= Total Costs**\n",
    "\n",
    "So in short 7.5 years since the wind farm starts operating, amount of electricity that is sold should cover all the costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To satisfy the above formula, the domain expert highlights a need to know the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- location and area of the site\n",
    "- wind climate for the site\n",
    "- wind turbine characteristic\n",
    "- costs\n",
    "- expected electricity price\n",
    "\n",
    "With a set of more detailed questions related, we would be able to outline the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wind farm: A group of wind turbines installed in a specific area to generate electricity from wind.\n",
    "- Wind turbine: A machine that converts wind energy into electrical power.\n",
    "- Meteorological mast: A tall tower equipped with sensors to measure wind and weather conditions at potential wind farm sites.\n",
    "- Anemometer: A device mounted on a mast to measure wind speed.\n",
    "- Wind vane: A sensor that shows the direction of the wind.\n",
    "- Site: A specific location being evaluated for the feasibility of building a wind farm.\n",
    "- Cost: The total expense involved in developing, building, and operating a wind farm.\n",
    "- Electricity price: The market rate at which the generated electricity can be sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, we can start forming the conceptual data model, for which NEAT offers an Excel template that we can leverage.\n",
    "Below is the command that will generate the template:\n"

    "## Capturing expert's knowledge in conceptual data model\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now fill in the template. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we are adding concepts (which in the current template are added in the `Classes` sheet, and are known as classes), we should try to select appropriate CDM concepts to build them off.\n",
    "To simplify the selection of CDM concepts that we want to base our concepts on, we will use the following rule of thumb(s):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Large infrastructures, physical objects that can be represented as a hierarchy of concepts (assets), and/or objects that can be seen as \"boxes\" to put other objects in / be part of we will base of `CogniteAsset`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Physical objects that do not have a clear hierarchical structure, or are part of other physical objects we will base off `CogniteEqupiment`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Any other concept that does follow rules 1 and 2, and requires human-readable properties, we will base off `CogniteDescribable`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the above, we have based our concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `WindFarm` of `CogniteAsset`: as this is a large infrastructure that will contain child assets `WindTurbine` and `MetMast`\n",
    "- `WindTurbine` of `CogniteAsset`: as it is the building block of `WindFarm` and enables further fine-graining to building components such as `Blade`, `Tower`, `Nacelle`, etc.\n",
    "- `MetMast` of `CogniteAsset`: as it is a part of `WindFarm`, and will be a \"box\" to \"add\" all sensors\n",
    "- `Anemometer`of `CogniteEquipment`: it is a sensor that attaches to a meteorological mast, not necessarily in a hierarchical form\n",
    "- `WindVane` of `CogniteEquipment`: the same reason as anemometer\n",
    "- `Site` of `CogniteDescribable`: it is not an asset or equipment, but it will hold information such as name and description.\n",
    "- `Cost` of `CogniteDescribable`: same reasoning as `Site`\n",
    "- `ElectricityPrice` of `CogniteDescribable`: same reasoning as `Site`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's make one small improvement. Since `Anemometer` and `WindVane` are both sensors, we can create a more generic concept `Sensor`, which is based on `CogniteEquipment`, and update the model such that `Anemometer` and `WindVane` implement `Sensor` instead of `CogniteEquipment`. **Why are we doing this?** This will allow us to define common properties of `Anemometer` and `WindVane` for `Sensor`, and only define custom properties for `Anemometer` and `WindVane`. \n",

A classic CDF resource [sequence](https://cognite-sdk-python.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/sequences.html) would be more appropriate here. However, we do not have a corresponding representation in Core Data Model for the Cognite sequence. Therefore, similar to the case of `Site`, we will create a helper concept `PowerCurve`, which we will base on `CogniteDescribable` and add the following custom properties:\n",
